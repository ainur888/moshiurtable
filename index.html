            WHOâ€™s Global Health Estimates provide the latest available data on causes of death and disability globally, by WHO region and country, by age, sex and by income group. 

            These estimates are produced using data from multiple sources, including national vital registration data, latest estimates from WHO technical programmes, United Nations
             partners and inter-agency groups, the Global Burden of Disease and other scientific studies. Before publishing, the GHE are reviewed by WHO Member States via consultation with national focal points and WHO country and regional offices.

            Mental health is fundamental to our collective and individual ability as humans to think, emote, interact with each other,
             earn a living and enjoy life. On this basis, the promotion, protection and restoration of mental health can be regarded as 
             a vital concern of individuals, communities and societies throughout the world.

                    Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.   <br>
                    Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special 
                    treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.
                    You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated 
                    surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.

                <p>The Coronavirus pandemic is complex and multidimensional; and seems to be unfolding faster than our understanding of it
                     and capacity to respond in a fully effective and comprehensive fashion. We are, however, learning a lot from the 
                     experiences of other countries with the pandemic and from a few states that were among the first to be hit hard by
                      rapidly growing infection rates. One of the major concerns is the many ethics and morality issues arising from the 
                      public policy challenges of the pandemic, especially as it relates to medical care decision-making and the fairness
                       of policies implemented to contain the pandemic and care for its victims. We still have a lot to learn, and we could 
                       benefit from an urgent national conversation about these issues regarding ethics and morality. In this section of our
                        COVID-19 website we will be posting and occasionally commenting on articles that we think are useful in understanding 
                        the most critical ethical challenges and dilemmas and the most just responses to them.</p>

                <p>Cholera is an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the toxigenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae
                     serogroup O1 or O139. An estimated 2.9 million cases and 95,000 deaths occur each year around the world. The infection
                      is often mild or without symptoms, but can be severe. Approximately 1 in 10 people who get sick with cholera will
                       develop severe symptoms such as watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these people, rapid loss of body 
                       fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours.</p>
